<h1>Data Grids</h1>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
  A common bug when opening defaults and files is the inablilty to easily add a new row.<br/>
To fix this, just edit the "Name" field, or any other text field for that matter, and add any character.<br/>
This will update the data grid and fix the issue. You can remove the character when the new empty row appears.
